Unsequence: confusing order of the production rules

The order of the production rules in the grammar should be set up in a
consistent manner, such that referred nonterminals in production rules refer
either up or down in the grammar. If [smell]Uncluster[/smell] and
[smell]Splat[/smell] are concerned with general placement of production rules,
this smell is about how they need to be structured to keep the reading
experience optimal.

In the past we have been using a grammar mutation called
[emph]SubGrammar[/emph] to improve the readability of grammars extracted from
language manuals [gwnet]SLEIR2014[/gwnet]. It would reorder the rules in the
following way: grab the starting symbol (usually the root of the grammar) and
list all its production rules, and then go through all nonterminals used in
their right hand sides one by one in the same sequence that they occur, add
their production rules to the target grammar and add the newly used
nonterminals to the backlog. Once the backlog was empty, the mutation stopped.
This was one of the possible strategies to get rid of both
[smell]Splat[/smell] and [smell]Unsequence[/smell], and to some extent of
[smell]Uncluster[/smell], but not the only one.

% we will show another strategy later in ... TODO
