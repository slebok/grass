AlmostAlphabet: seemingly incomplete collections

The completeness of some character classes and terminal choices can be
predicted, and compared to the actual value given by the grammar. For example,
if a character class includes all Latin letters except one or all whitespace
characters except [verb]\r[/verb], it may be an error. Similarly, if a
preterminal is defined as a choice of all other alphanumeric terminals in the
grammar (common for keyword definitions), then not a single one of them should
be skipped.
