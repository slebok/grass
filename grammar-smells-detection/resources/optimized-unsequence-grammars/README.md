# Grammars for which optimised the up and down referencing (Unsequence Smell)

With an [up-down-referencing optimisation algorithm](https://github.com/slebok/grass/blob/master/grammar-smells-detection/src/smells/UpDownReferences.rsc#L60)
we have rewritten 3 grammars to analyse what this optimisation did with the overall structure and maintainability.

These grammars are:
  * [Ada 2005 Grammar](https://github.com/slebok/grass/blob/master/grammar-smells-detection/resources/optimized-unsequence-grammars/ada-2005.txt), which is available on the Grammar Zoo [here](http://slebok.github.io/zoo/ada/ada2005/lncs-4348/extracted/index.html).
  * [GAIA Grammar](https://github.com/slebok/grass/blob/master/grammar-smells-detection/resources/optimized-unsequence-grammars/gaia.txt), which is available on the Grammar Zoo [here](http://slebok.github.io/zoo/dsl/multi-agent/gaia/simon/extracted/index.html).
  * [Câ™¯ 1.0 Grammar](https://github.com/slebok/grass/blob/master/grammar-smells-detection/resources/optimized-unsequence-grammars/csharp-iso23270-2003.txt), which is available on the Grammar Zoo [here](http://slebok.github.io/zoo/csharp/v1.x/iso-23270-2003/extracted/index.html).
