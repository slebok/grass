Foldable: nonterminal's right hand side is not unique

This smell occurs when the clone is formed not between full definitions of two
nonterminals, but when the right hand side of one nonterminal occurs as a
subexpression in the right hand side of another nonterminal. Conceptually they
are still clones and suffer from all known consequences of coupled evolution,
but the solution is different: instead of merging the nonterminals, the
subexpression needs to be folded into a nonterminal that defines it.
