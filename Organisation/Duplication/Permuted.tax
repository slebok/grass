Permuted: permutations in commutative combinators

Clones modulo permutations (e.g., [code]A | B[/code] vs [code]B | A[/code])
are confusing: if the choice used in the notation is commutative, they are
just [smell]Clone[/smell]s, otherwise if the choice is ordered, having both
[code]A / B[/code] and [code]B / A[/code] within the same grammar is even more
confusing for everyone.
