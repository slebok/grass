Echo: same rule occurs twice or more

A nonterminal definition is echoed if it is included in the grammar several
times, each of which is identical to any other. Echoes were found in the Java
Language Specification as a result of manual (not tool supported) creation of
both the grammar and language documentation. They were merged in the grammar
extractor---that is, during the phase of converting the original HTML document
to the first version of the grammar [cite]p.348/SCAM-J-2009-LammelZ11[/cite].
A similar error was observed earlier in the C\# standard
[cite]Too-Sharp2005[/cite] and later in other languages [cite]Zoo2015[/cite].
