SayMyName: a misspelling or improper use of the natural language

The information is conveyed both by the structure specified in the grammar
notation and by natural language used for naming nonterminals and modules. In
small grammars misspellings and misnamings are easy to overlook since humans
are naturally capable of that. When the grammar size increases, primitive
automation techniques are used like plain text search, and such a search query
looking for all statements will not find the one labelled with ``staetment''.
