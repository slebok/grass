Splat: nonterminal fragments scattered over the grammar

Since definitions of vertical nonterminals (see [smell]ZigZag[/smell]) consist
of several production rules, these rules can be distributed over the grammar
and not focused in one place. This may be bad, especially if most of the rules
are collected together, and only one or two are elsewhere.
