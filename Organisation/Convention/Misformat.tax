Misformat: misleading formatting

There are many formatting mistakes one can make when creating a grammar
without proper tool support [cite]LDTA-2012-Zaytsev[/cite]
[cite]SCAM-J-2009-LammelZ11[/cite]. Mostly they revolve around mistypings,
misspellings, misalignments, etc, and result in actual incorrect constructs in
extracted grammars. However, there can be other, more subtle smells within
formatting of a grammar, that do not change the way the machine processes it,
but do change the way a tired grammarware engineer may understand it. The most
canonic example of misleading formatting would be (mind the colon, not a
semicolon, following [code]ghi[/code]):

[example]
        abc :
                def;
                ghi:
                jkl;
        mno :
                pqr;
[/example]
