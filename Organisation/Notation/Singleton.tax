Singleton: trivial choice, sequence or conjunction

The designers of grammar notations, as all DSL designers, try to make them fit
the domain, but never achieve absolute perfection. In particular, multiary
symbols with arity of 2 and up, are commonly expressed in such a way that
allows their use on an empty or trivial list of arguments. Single-element
sequences, disjunctions and conjunctions like this are easy to detect and
remove by algebraic rewriting.
