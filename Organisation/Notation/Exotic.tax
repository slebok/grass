Exotic: too idiosyncratic notational features decrease portability

This smell is in contradiction with [smell]Underuse[/smell], and states that
using notational features that are uncommon, obscure or overly exotic, should
be limited. Excessive use of features idiosyncratic for one particular
notation, will result in a vendor lock-in. For example, if a notation allows
context handling (pushing the grammar outside the comfort zone of CFGs), using
it is only fully justified when the result is too cumbersome otherwise.
