Superset: parser spec is too relaxed

Some grammars represent a superset of the intended language. This may become a
problem if the parser based on the grammar is to be used as a correctness
oracle, since in this role it is inadequate. Overly relaxed grammars are
routinely used in other scenarios such as software analytics and
inter-language translation, and can be very useful there.
